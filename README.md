## Steganography

Letâ€™s understand what is steganography.

### What is steganography?

> [Steganography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography) is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video.

### What is the advantage of steganography over cryptography?
> The advantage of steganography over [cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography) alone is that the intended secret message does not attract attention to itself as an object of scrutiny. Plainly visible encrypted messages, no matter how unbreakable they are, arouse interest and may in themselves be incriminating in countries in which [encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption) is illegal.

In other words, steganography is more discreet than cryptography when we want to send a secret information. On the other hand, the hidden message is easier to extract.
